## Implemented vLLM Components:
- **Engine Core:** Synchronous engine that efficiently queues and processes multiple prompts in parallel.
  
- **KV Cache Manager:** Allocates and reuses transformer key-value memory blocks for fast attention computation.
  
- **Synchronous Batched Decoding:** Runs all requests in lockstep, maximizing GPU utilization and throughput.

  Each plot visualizes the total tokens generated and batching efficiency compared to the naive baseline.

## Throughput & Speedup
- **Average throughput improvement (speedup): 2x – 10x** across most realistic settings (batch sizes 4–8, max_tokens 16–32).

- **Maximum observed speedup:** 43x for small prompt/large batch/long output scenarios.

- **Typical speedup: 2x – 7x** for batch sizes 4–8 and outputs of 16–32 tokens.

- **Throughput is maximized** for large max_tokens and batch sizes.

- **Latency increases** for the largest jobs, but bulk inference benefits heavily from batching.

## Representative Benchmark Results

| PromptLen | BatchSize | MaxTokens | OptTokens | NaiveTokens | Speedup |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| 8         | 1         | 64        | 961       | 22          | 43.68   |
| 8         | 8         | 64        | 1321      | 460         | 2.87    |
| 32        | 8         | 64        | 2826      | 387         | 7.30    |
| 64        | 4         | 64        | 3627      | 256         | 14.17   |
| 128       | 4         | 64        | 1312      | 210         | 6.25    |
| 128       | 8         | 64        | 2130      | 388         | 5.49    |

- OptTokens and NaiveTokens show the total number of output tokens generated by the optimized (batched) and naive (sequential) engines, respectively, for each setting.

- Speedup is the ratio of optimized to naive throughput, indicating how much batching improves efficiency.
